UCURV toolbox version 2.0 

Implementation of the Uniform Discrete Curvelet Transform for any dimension.
The toolbox can run curvelet transform in 2,3,4,5 and more dimension, as long
as the data can be held in MATLAB memory. There are three main subroutines,
ucurvmdwin calculates all the curvelet windows for a particular transform
parameters, ucurvmddec and ucurvmdre do the decomposition (forward transform)
and reconstruction (inverse transform).
